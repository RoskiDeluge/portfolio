# Roberto Delgado Blog

Hi. I started learning about the Web in 1995 when I typed the URL for the Zapatista’s website in Netscape to learn about their fight in Chiapas. As an independent consultant, I’ve helped my clients with web strategy, design/development, and digital production.

I (try to) write monthly about things that strike my fancy, often coding/development related, but usually they veer into the more speculative/personal terrain.

I'm always open to connecting with folks that are working on cool things. Drop me a line if anything here connects with you.

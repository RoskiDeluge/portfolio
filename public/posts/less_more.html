          For as long as I've been interested in philosophy, I have been drawn
          to the extremes. It's hard not to be. Whether it's the story of Thales
          making a big bet on the production of the olive presses that made him
          rich or Diogenes the Cynic naked and crass when he met Alexander the
          Great, these stories, among other things, teach us that ultimately
          we'll be called to take an extreme position to validate our life's
          worth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm starting to question that position. I'm moving away from the
          minimalist state of "less is more" and the maximalist aim of "more is
          more" to a more balanced "less and more" perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like all drawn out processes, this conviction took time to emerge. For
          me it's been a steady erosion that's been happening in the background.
          The material that's been eroding is my body and soul and I've been
          letting it happen unconsciously. I have let the instrument of my mind
          be hijacked by theories (I won't venerate them anymore with the title
          of "philosophies") that are steeped in extremism.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I have needed is a return to myself. To be in love again. And
          there's good precedent for this new line of thought. "Perhaps love is
          the process of me leading you back to yourself," as Leo Buscaglia said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main driver of this change has been my discovery of philosopher
          Susanne Langer. I'm reading <em>Philosophy in a New Key</em> and it's
          radically changing how I thought about the value of all symbolic
          activity. When Langer tells the age old story of how we became the
          rational animal, she doesn't do what countless others do, which is to
          misinterpret a symbolically rich and developed state as a primitive
          one.

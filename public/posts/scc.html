            Turns out that the possible and impossible, also known as the
            counterfactual, has been neglected in physics.

          "Can can," as I see it, expresses that something is possible, "no can
          no can" that it is impossible. As the truth of things is approached,
          the less official the road to it seems. In a neat twist of affairs, if
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_theory"
            >constructor theory</a
          >
          is true, then the above phrase from Hawaii's pidgin may have the
          distinction of expressing the fundamental nature of reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the "Science of Can and Can't," Dr. Chiara Marletto explores the
          nature of possibility as it relates to the traditional conception of
          physics. The main focus of her work concerns "the counterfactual
          properties of physical systems." Turns out that the possible and the
          impossible, also known as the counterfactual, have been neglected in
          physics. Marletto doesn't just say that this has been wrong, she says
          that our understanding of reality has been impoverished as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I was reading her book, I thought of another person deeply engaged
          with questions of counterfactuality, the philosopher David Lewis.
          Lewis pioneered the metaphysical domain of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_realism">modal realism</a
          >. His full acceptance of the reality of possible worlds was
          controversial, to say the least, among fellow analytic philosophers
          like Saul Kripke and Robert Stalnaker, neither of which minced words
          in saying how wrong headed Lewis was.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are some obvious differences between modal realism and
          constructor theory, top among these is that possible worlds are
          causally closed and can't interact with each other.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_modal_realism"
            >Extended modal realism</a
          >, developed by Takashi Yagisawa, does seem to take a step in the
          direction of the constructor theory by allowing objects to have modal
          and non-modal properties. Thus, what's possible is itself a modal
          property that can be categorized according to the type of possibility:
          logical, physical, metaphysical.
        </p>
        <p>
          What fascinates me is how Marletto's work potentially provides a
          massive unification of domains traditionally thought to be separate.
          Here I'm thinking not just of the huge unification that she details
          between information theory and thermodynamics, which already is
          revolutionary, but a larger one that includes an extension and
          deepening of modality in general.

        <p>Why this immodest drive to know exactly what the agent is doing?</p>

        <p>
          When the neural network (deep learning) paradigm was chosen, wasn't it obvious that we
          would need to give something up? That with enough scale, the models would become
          inscrutable to their makers?
        </p>

        <p>
          Openclaw can take control of the machine at a fundamental level and abstract away the
          process of how it does so, but many people are willing to give up this control in
          exchange for the utility of a machine possessed of a soul.
        </p>

        <p>How can I trust your transformations so they're allowed to inform my own?</p>

              If we cannot inspect every internal move, what forms of accountability remain
              meaningful?
            </li>
            <li>
              Is interpretability a technical requirement, or a moral one we owe to each other?
            </li>
            <li>
              At what point does convenience become a quiet surrender of authorship over our own
              judgments?

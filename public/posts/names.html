        <p>
          As I was finishing up grad school and looking for ways to satisfy the
          final requirements for my degree, I attempted to answer two research
          questions on the "digital divide" by exploring a concept I called
          "ambient advertising." Don't ask me to clarify what I mean by this
          because I haven't the faintest idea. But what I remember about this
          experience, after the committee quickly rejected my feeble attempt at
          an answer, is the power of naming.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the committee should have said upon rejecting my work was that I
          was attempting to name a phenomenon prematurely, without establishing
          any sort of track record in the academic literature. They should also
          have said that I needed to design and implement a relevant quantitative
          or qualitative study of the media, which are the two main avenues of
          research in mass communications, and gather results that would lend
          support to my suggestion that such a thing as I was naming actually
          exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas, I was too much of a poet (or a dilettante) to abide by these
          implicit rules on naming in the academy. I did eventually find a
          different way to graduate, but this, I think, was the formative
          experience of grad school for me. By having my attempt at naming
          rejected like this, I learned that the act of naming is powerfully
          correlated with experiential knowledge of the context within which
          naming occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dan Abromov, the talented developer of Redux and now a key engineer on
          the React team, engaged in some naming himself during his fantastic,
          if short lived, <em>JustJavascript</em> email course. In his case,
          however, he brought years of experience with the JavaScript namespace
          to bear on his act of naming. One of the first things he did was
          clarify what was meant by a value in his JavaScript mental model. As
          he explains it: "In the beginning was the Value. What is a value? It's
          hard to say. This is like asking what a number is in math, or what a
          point is in geometry. <strong>A value is a thing in the JavaScript
          universe.</strong>"
        </p>
        <p>
          It's interesting to me that he's not saying what a value is
          existentially in the JavaScript universe, but he's intimating that
          values refer to things in the universe, so, in other words, a name
          describes a functional relation between things.

        <p>
          When I began my last semester of senior year in college, I got
          ambitious and decided to do an independent study supervised by the
          artist, writer and teacher Julius Lester.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the throes of young love (I met the mother of my children that
          year) and the general exuberance of the end of college, I badly
          neglected my study with professor Lester. Seeing that I was just two
          credits away from graduation, I needed to at least pass the
          independent study and so Lester took pity on me and gave me, as he put
          it, "the gift of a D-, because you really deserve an F."
        </p>
        <p>
          I admit that I was too self involved at the time to care about his
          gift and only much later, when I'd had a few years of the ups and
          downs of life did I write to thank him. I wrote him an email from my
          small porch in our little, sunny granny flat in San Jose, California.
          I mentioned to him that I'd been too embarrassed to properly thank him
          all those years ago and wanted to do so now. I suspect that I also
          wrote because I secretly needed guidance. He wrote back and reassured
          me that he remembered me and accepted my thanks but also said that the
          study experience turned out in a way that neither of us wanted. He
          graciously gave me some words of wisdom that I now cringe at a bit,
          not because he gave them, but from being so lost as to need them in
          the first place. But what I treasure most are his closing words, he
          said "whenever you decide to speak, I'll make the time to listen." We
          began an email correspondence that I now wish had been more frequent.
        </p>

          Julius Lester passed away two days ago at the age of 78. He was the
          type of teacher that expected the highest rigor in the things that are
          usually given short shrift, like expressing your own thoughts and
          living out your passions. A beautiful writer and photographer, he
          would not let any instance slide in which he felt you were cheating
          your heart's potential.

        <h2>FOCUS</h2>
        <p>The two fundamental principles of the lean method are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Declare your victories.</li>
          <li>
            People do not buy products, people buy solutions to problems.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          So how can we build a product or service that solves people's
          problems? One clear signal that whatever you have built is actively
          solving people's problems is expressed as product-market fit (PMF).
        </p>
        <h3>What satisfies you?</h3>
        <p>
          All people live in an attraction or aversion loop. People are
          passionate about things they are attracted to and averse to the things
          that bring discomfort or pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          People (users, customers, developers, builders, and so on) are guided
          by principles. And one core guiding principle for developers is to
          declare your victories in advance.
        </p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>
          As a developer or builder, we usually attach our passion to the things
          we're building or coding. But if we build from our principles, we can
          remain uncommitted to a particular product and service if it doesn't
          bring us closer to achieving our declared victories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, so you've declared your victories, what's next? Now we need to
          commit to solving a problem in a way that lets us realize our declared
          victories. How can we do that? By making something that achieves
          product-market fit.
        </p>

          Justin Wilcox proposes five assumptions that all products or services
          that have achieved PMF have managed to answer successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          What follows is a list of the five assumptions and Wilcox's proposed
          tests to answer each of them:
        </p>
        <h3>Finding early adopters test</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption:</strong> There are people out there that are trying
          to solve this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who are the people that are trying to solve the problem that your
          solution is also trying to solve, and can you find them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Use customer interviews to determine how customers describe their
          problem (marketing copy) and where they go to find solutions
          (marketing channels).
        </p>
        <p>
          The customer's descriptions of the problem will be used as the
          marketing copy and the places they go to seek the solution will be the
          marketing channels.
        </p>
        <h3>Offer test</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption:</strong> I am able to reach those people and
          describe the problem in a way that makes them want to consider my
          solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here you find out how prospects are engaging with your offer and how
          you need to iterate your marketing (copy and channels).
        </p>
        <h3>Currency test</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption:</strong> People are willing to pay me for the
          solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          People will pay you the money you need to achieve your declared
          victory, if you build this thing or service. Ways to test this is via
          landing page pre-sales or letters of intent.
        </p>
        <h3>Utility test</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption:</strong> The solution actually does solve the
          problem in a way that satisfies the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can you actually solve people's problems? In other words, does your
          product provide value to the user? If it does based on the results of
          the previous tests, then the next step is to become the solution to
          the problem by building a manual solution (Minimum Viable Product).
          It's easier to take feedback from your customers if your solution is
          manual rather than automated.
        </p>
        <h3>Scaling test</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption:</strong> The solution can be automated and scaled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now is the time to build software and robots to replace you (the MVP)
          and automate. It's also good at this stage to reach out to the second
          or third marketing channels and second or third customer segments.

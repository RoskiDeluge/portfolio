          <p class="post-meta">
            I've been thinking a lot about honor recently, specifically the
            question of how we can properly honor the things and people in our
            lives.

          Robert Bly's magnificent book <em>Iron John</em> gives an introduction
          to the ancient initiation traditions of Northern Europe as
          crystallized in the Grimm Brothers' story. I can't praise the book
          enough as a masterpiece of the poetic imagination. Bly deftly unpacks
          the mythological layers to reveal and reinterpret the wild man, or the
          heart of the masculine polarity, a central aspect of life that seems
          as absent now from our cultural imagination as it was when the book
          was published in 1990.
        </p>
        <p>
          On re-reading the book, though, I was struck by a small detail. Very
          little notice is taken of one of the wild man's most important, if not
          central, characteristics, namely his power. This elision from the
          drama depicting the fight between aspects of the repressed male psyche
          seems to leave a crucial feature unexplored.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we were to imagine Nietzsche's take on Iron John, for instance,
          we'd have a clearer focus on that part of the wild man that drives the
          action forward, his power. Bly, unfortunately, in the one place where
          he mentions Nietzsche, does so to disparage his being stuck in the
          warrior stage of initiation. I call it unfortunate because this is
          precisely the point at which Nietzsche's philosophy can amplify the
          effect of Iron John. Nietzsche says in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>
          that "only the powerful know how to honor, that is their art and their
          realm of invention."

          I've been thinking a lot about honor recently, specifically the
          question of how we can properly honor the things and people in our
          lives. The story of Iron John gives a hint as to the source of honor
          and how it flows in society. It's telling that in the scene where the
          boy is taken by the wild man, separated from his family, and asked to
          watch over the sacred spring, the wild man makes a point of separating
          the fact that he has gold from the fact that he has power. He tells
          the boy to guard the spring and let nothing fall into the water, for
          that would dishonor the spring. It's important to notice here that the
          wild man doesn't say that if something falls into the water, <em>he</em>
          would be dishonored, but that <em>the spring</em> would be. To me, this
          creates a clear separation, and what the wild man is telling the boy
          is that he is the source of the spring's honor and nothing that the
          boy does or fails to do will affect the source.
        </p>
        <p>
          To my mind, the lesson here is that until the boy can learn to
          recognize, reflect upon, and integrate the true source of honor in the
          world, not only will he not be able to honor, but he won't know his
          own power.

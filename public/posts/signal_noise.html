          "Shannon proposed an unsettling inversion. Ignore the physical channel
          and accept its limits: we can overcome noise by manipulating our
          messages. The answer to noise is not in how loudly we speak, but in
          how we say what we say." -

          One of the fascinating things about working in web development is
          being able to trace the trajectory of what you're doing in a broader
          history. Coding itself is an activity as ancient as the cuneiform
          script on clay tablets written by the scribes of Mesopotamia and the
          Ancient Near East. I highly recommend a google search of these
          cuneiform tablets to anyone interested in symbols and communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was learning communication theory in school, there was a lot of
          hand wringing over the initial, mathematical, model of communication
          because of the so called "hypodermic needle" theory of communication
          effects that it implied. In this view, all that was needed to engineer
          social change was to spread media devices (that is, television and
          radio) to unruly populations and you could implant or incept your
          ideology directly into their minds and affect their behavior. Of
          course, after the initial fervor of communication and cybernetic
          studies post WWII, other theories came along that were more
          sociological and attempted to bridge the gap between the machine
          centered transmission of intelligence and people focused communication
          of meaning.
        </p>

          What I hadn't realized until recently, is that some of us working in
          this space have had the privilege of seeing a complete shift in the
          concerns of media. During my first semester of grad school in 2005,
          for instance, we received the news that the last telegram was sent and
          that the historic medium was being shutdown. Take that in for a
          moment. In 2005, when Myspace and Facebook were vying for users,
          people were still sending telegrams.
        </p>

          I think that what's underappreciated today is what the information
          pioneers did to the noise vs. signal ratio. Since the time of
          Aristotle and, arguably, since we learned to communicate with words,
          humans have struggled to contain the noise that distorts the signals
          (messages) that we want to send. The brilliance of the information
          theorists, culminating in the formalization of this work in the theory
          of Claude Shannon, is the complete elimination of noise. This may seem
          like small potatoes today, but if you think about all the things that
          could and did affect the ability to send signals perfectly through
          space, you can start to appreciate the magnitude of this
          accomplishment.

# Roberto Delgado

Hi. I’m a web developer based in Honolulu, HI. I started learning about the Web in 1995 when I typed the URL for the Zapatista’s website in Netscape to learn about their fight in Chiapas. As an independent consultant, I’ve helped my clients with web strategy, design/development, and digital production.

I _try_ to write monthly about things that strike my fancy, usually development related, but sometimes they veer into philosophy or art stuff.

I'm always open to connecting with folks that are working on cool things. Drop me a line if anything here connects with you.

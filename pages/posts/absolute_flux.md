# Absolute Flux

I've been listening to the [History of Philosophy](https://historyofphilosophy.net/) podcast. Episode 7 presents Parmenides's ideas on the unchanging nature of reality and how the world is full, meaning that there are no gaps of non-being that separate one thing from another.

The Eleatics were a fantastic group of philosophers that in one way or other were disciples of this basic Parminidean idea of the oneness of everything and how all change is an illusion. In a violation of the ethos of the HoP podcast I'd like to leap over a huge gap and go straight to Nietzsche, who seems to me the most radical critic of the Eleatics.

Nietzsche not only believes that change exists, but that absolute diachronic flux is the fundamental reality. Nietzsche also controversially proposed a model of the cosmos that eternally repeats which keeps the whole thing in something like a dynamic equilibrium: the flux blows everything up at all times, the return brings everything back exactly as it was.

I've been thinking about the nature of flux in my life. Much of my frustrations, it seems to me in retrospect, where in one way or another all tied to a fixed conception of my personal identity. So my thinking was ruled by being this or that role and always more or less competent in this or that activity, and so on. As I work on my projects as a developer and in my new role as dad, I appreciate how much the practice of writing code (especially debugging) and rearing children has helped me to become viscerally aware of flux.

I've also started to become more aware of how much, if not all, of our experiences are transformational in the [L.A. Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformative_Experience) sense of the term. As she explains, a transformational experience has epistemic and preferential effects in that our first person perspective changes what we know and what we prefer after having the experience. What intrigues me is how this area of flux - absolute flux - interfaces with culture. I use culture in a very broad sense as fixed patterns of collective behavior that also assume a level of fixed identities as a substrate.

Basically I'm interested in this tension between culture and flux. It seems to me that nothing can be tethered to absolute flux, no identities and much less anything that depends on the fixed stratum of identity. So the key question becomes, how can cultural formations adapt to the reality of the flux of identity that undergirds them?

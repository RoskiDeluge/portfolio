## The work of art in the age of digital reproduction

The NFT goes beyond digital art. This is hard to perceive these days with all the hype and excitement going around. Be that as it may, I've been orienting myself by reading Walter Benjamin's classic essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" and found an analogue to our current situation when he describes the fallout from the mechanical reproduction of art as symptomatic of a larger change. He says, "One might generalize by saying: the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition. By making many reproductions it substitutes a plurality of copies for a unique existence" (171).

Benjamin thought that mechanical reproduction had affected the aura of art. While it's overblown to say that our era has gone past mechanical reproduction, it may be safe to say that it has accelerated to a sublime level. The aura of a work of art is what testifies to its existence, and is the ultimate proof of its authenticity. It's interesting that Benjamin introduces the concept of aura as a sort of modulo operator. Within the emerging regime of technical reproducibility that he was discussing, this remainder was what was missing in the plethora of copies of art that were flooding the world.

Mechanical reproduction of art also depended crucially on suitable substrates that would affect what Benjamin called "its suitable duration to its testimony to the history which it has experienced" (171). This may explain why he states that the "whole concept of authenticity is outside technical --and not just technical-- reproducibility" (170). In other words, the realm that up to now guaranteed the authenticity of art had nothing to do with the development of the technology of reproduction.  

One of the fascinating things about the NFT is how it enlarges what can be recorded as art, or its function as a new substrate. For the first time, an ontology of conceptual art is possible because the concept can be grounded somewhere and sometime immutably. Avant guard art practices had a time and a place, of course, but their aura suffered from an extreme ephemerality.

art forfeited its authenticity when it embraced the digital

two concepts prevalent in crypto that are being imported into digital art are mutability and fungibility

the precense as a unique aspect of the work of art that testified to its authenticity dissolved with the digital era


the battles around reproducibility, or in more grounded terms, copyright dna file sharing

the massive substructure of fractional reserve banking

establishing uniqueness is hard in a medium that operates on abstracting away all uniqueness in the form of data

the same underlying material ... the art object to the extent that it could be digitized and still preserve its form unaltered while its content was annihilated and reconstituted ... like Dionysus, almost completely destroyed except for his heart

information wanting to be free has made it hard to work on rights, property, uniqueness, identity, exchange

digital art didn't exist anywhere in conventional time or space, which is a problem for the first factor in authenticity, and the owners of digital art weren't known, which is a problem for establishing a history (provenance), because the technology enabled the freeing of any material that could be digitzed and preserve for the consumer an experience of the art

NFT is the substrate, just like the invention of photographic film and the ability of the film itself to have the requisite sensitivity and the form to capture reality. Like photography, its an invention that goes well beyond image making and over time changes our perception. The NFT goes well beyond collectibles and digital art, it names the beginning of a new recording substrate for a mode of perception the character of which we're beginning to explore and that will itself need new names.


an indelible part of the aura of a work of art is its presence, but by the time we get to Vapowave's AESTHETICS the aura of the work of art has been pulverized and used as fertilizer for strange grafts that emerged as a bricolage of internet detritus. 

incidental what the art is about, its subject doesn't matter except as a means to generate a record in the blockchain. Perhaps we can think about this as the hash value of the work of art.

On the one hand we could say that the NFT serves as a means of preserving part of the aura of the work of art. On the other hand, it is merely a hash in a database that does no such thing, it abstracts all of the most essential features of the art to retain a record of its transaction history.

in the technological progression of the reproduction of images, the physical part of the phenomenon was not abstracted away like it has during our era. This means that any consumer of images could in fact ask after the ultimate physical substrate that carried an image, wether that was canvas and paint, or celulloid and silver nitrate. One could point to bits as the analogous substrate, but the difference is that bits are a unique substrate in their digital nature, with a corresponding loss in the analog fidelity of the image object in relation to the real object. A different way to say it is that the physical part of the phenomenon was preserved, until the digital era changed the substrate and enabled new phenomena to emerge.

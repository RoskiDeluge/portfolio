# Synthesis in The Age of The Work of Art

_"The equipment-free aspect of reality here has become the height of artifice; the sight of immediate reality has become an orchid in the land of technology."_ - Walter Benjamin, The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction

The question in Bejamin was about how a work's aura was preserved despite its mechanical reproduction. Mechanical reproduction was the key achievement and worry. Photo mechanical reproduction shook the ontological status of the art object. An exact visual replica could be made to stand in for the original in some ways. Being in the presence of an art object was no longer necessary to experience its aura. The potential audience for works was now determined by how far the information in the photograph could travel. Nothing less was at stake here than the total transformation of the value of a work of art. Before this moment what anchored the value was the ritual use, but now that potential was enshrined in the exhibition value.

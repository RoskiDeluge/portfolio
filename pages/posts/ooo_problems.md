# Problems with OOO

Object Oriented Ontology is a type of sociological theory. Despite its seemingly radical thesis on the opacity of objects, which would lead one to believe that it must be informed by a computational view, this is not the case. On the contrary, while Graham Harman does do a hat tip to object oriented programming in his treatise on OOO, ultimately, he says, the two approaches deviate. 

This is a missed opportunity for OOO, since the object view in computer science, and computational ontologies more generally, are deeply, if not fundamentally, informative on the nature of reality. 
Harman positions OOO as a contrarian view which treats "objects" as more encompassing than the supposed reductionist use of the same term in computing. But he suggests that his use of the term object is more encompassing.
